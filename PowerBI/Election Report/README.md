### Recommedations

Based on a personal survey carried out, I can make the following recommendations:
- Fear of violence: In the build-up to elections, politicians should refrain from utterances that could heat up the polity.
- Failed promises: Elected political office holders must ensure to keep to their electioneering compaign promises
- Lack of awareness: The National Orientation Agency must embark on more sensitization programmes before elections
- Disenfranchisement: The electoral umpire must ensure adequate and well-functioning equipment
