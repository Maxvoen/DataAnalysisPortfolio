### MAJOR POINT FOR ANALYSIS
Which U.S. states generate the highest and lowest revenue?
What sub-categories is driving revenue?
Which regions or customer segments are most valuable?

### DATA SOURCE
Superstores Sales Data: The primary data used for this analysis is the "SuperStore-Sales-DataSet.xlsx" file, containing detailed information about each sale made by the company.

### ANALYSIS PROCEDURE
#### DATA PREPARATION, CLEANING, AND EXPLORATORY DATA ANALYSIS (EDA) USING EXCEL AND POWER QUERY
- First, I checked the dataset to know the relevant columns for this analysis
- I checked for null or blank rows. I had none
- I checked and removed duplicate values
- Uploading the datasets on Power Query.
- I removed the columns to only those relevant for the analysis
- The columns were formatted to the suitable data types.
- The cleaned dataset was uploaded to Power BI for proper analysis and Visualization.
- I added a revenue generated column (Sales*Quantity) and shipping days using DAX Calculated Column

## MAJOR FINDINGS

- California, New York, Texas, and Washington were the top 4 highest revenue-generating states in the US.
- The top 4 subcategories of items being purchased range from Phones, chairs, binders, storage. This suggests that work-from-home jobs might be on the increase.
- In the customer segment, the Consumer segment had the highest number of orders. Corporate customers contributed more to average revenue per transaction.
- People mostly preferred Cash on delivery (COD) compared to online payments and the use of cards. The reason might be to be sure that what they ordered is what they receive.
- People used standard class as the shipping mode because it is relatively cheap and also delivers within 3-8 days of the order.

## MY RECOMMENDATIONS
These are my recommendations:

- Speed up shipping timelines, especially for high-value customers using Standard Class
- Offer better discounts to Corporate buyers in low-performing states to boost volume
- Shift focus to high-margin subcategories like Chairs and Technology accessories
- Monitor regional KPIs monthly using a centralized dashboard
- Target the Online and Corporate segments in your social media marketing campaigns
